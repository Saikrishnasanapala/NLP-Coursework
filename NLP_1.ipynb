Food was very good as well, considering that we tried the budget selection (though I wish the pork belly that I ordered was roasted a bit longer, so that fat was more of a melt-in-your-mouth experience). Wine list selection is good and wine-by-the-glass was generously filled to the top. Traditional French decour was pleasant though the hall was rather noisy - the restaurant was full and we had to raise our voices to be able to maintain a conversation.',\n",

To sum it up: Service varies from good to mediorce, depending on which waiter you get; generally it is just average Ok. Seating is always prompt, though the restaurant does fill up in the evening. Food is usually very good, though ocasionally I wondered about freshmess of raw vegatables in side orders. As many other reviewers noticed, your order is often slow to arrive - this is particularly true in the evening but is not a problem during lunch time. The decor is vibrant and eye-pleasing with several semi-private boths on the right side of the dining hall, which are great for a date.\",\n",

The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse. Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable.

We were very pleasantly surprised. The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch. When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort. Truly the mark of an attentive waiter. I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.\",\n",
